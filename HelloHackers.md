## Hello Hackers
+ In the Hello Hackers module in the first part `Intro to commands` I learnt the following things:

  + There is a command `whoami` which displays the user's name
  + Linux is case sensitive it treats uppercase and lower case differently
  + I got my first flag by writing the `hello` command in the terminal.

+ The second part was `Intro to Arguments`:
+ Code:
  + hacker@hellointro-to-arguments:$ hello hackers
Success! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{YpG03-5ygfSrphrJ-8djFDxjQhC.dhjNyUDL0AzN0czW}

Following is what I learnt:
  + The command is followed by an argument which in this case was hackers written after the command Hello
  + After writing `hello hackers` i got the flag which was used to complete the second part
